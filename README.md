# Goodybee - A Recipe Finder

Goodybee is a web app made with the Edamam Recipe Search API. Users can find recipes from all over the web, filter search results, read extra details for each recipe, go to the original source for a recipe, and save their favorite recipes when they create an account.

This was built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, EJS, Passport.js for authenticating users, Bcrypt for hashing passwords, and Nodemailer for sending reset password links to users.
